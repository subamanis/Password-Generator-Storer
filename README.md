# Password-Generator-Storer
This is a password-generator/storer implementing a custom encryption algorithm and BCrypt that I created for personal use,
because I wanted to change my passwords. It is by no means completely secure, but it is much more secure than using the same
password everywhere. I enjoyed building it and learned a lot about cryptography
